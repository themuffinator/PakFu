# PakFu Credits

## Project
- Creator and lead: **themuffinator** (DarkMatter Productions)

## Core Technology
- **Qt 6** (Core, Gui, Widgets, Network, OpenGL/OpenGLWidgets, Multimedia/MultimediaWidgets)
  - Application framework, UI, rendering integration, and media plumbing
- **miniz** (vendored in `src/third_party/miniz`)
  - ZIP-family archive handling backend

## Compatibility And Format Lineage
PakFu supports many game/archive/media formats from idTech-era ecosystems and adjacent titles.
That compatibility is informed by public format lineage, engine behavior, and historical data layouts from:
- id Software family engines and assets (Quake, Quake II, Quake III, Doom-family)
- Related studio ecosystems that built on or extended those formats (for example Raven/Ritual/Gray Matter era pipelines)
- Community-maintained references from open-source engine projects and modding documentation

## Thanks
- Modding communities who preserved format knowledge, test assets, and practical edge cases across decades of tool use
